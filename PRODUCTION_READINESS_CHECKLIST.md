## üß™ Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing Steps

1. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Unauthenticated State**
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000`
   - Verify sign-in buttons appear for save/like
   - Check browser console for any 401 errors
   - Right-click save button (should show error message)

3. **Test Authenticated State**
   - Sign in to the application
   - Verify save/like buttons work normally
   - Right-click save button and verify folder menu
   - Test saving tools to folders

4. **Test Different Pages**
   - Visit category pages
   - Visit individual tool pages
   - Verify consistent behavior across all pages

5. **Run Browser Test Script**
   - Open browser console
   - Copy and paste the content of `test-authentication-fixes.js`
   - Check test results

### Automated Testing

```bash
# Run unit tests
npm test -- __tests__/components/SaveButton.test.tsx
npm test -- __tests__/components/LikeButton.test.tsx

# Run all tests
npm test

# Run production build test
npm run build:production
```
